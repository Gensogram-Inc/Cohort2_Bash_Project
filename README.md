# Bash Scripts Collection

Welcome to the Bash Scripts Collection repository! This repository is a collection of simple and useful Bash scripts designed for beginners to practice and learn Bash scripting. Each script serves a specific purpose and demonstrates basic scripting concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and file operations!!!
